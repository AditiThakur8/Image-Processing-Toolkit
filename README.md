# Image Processing Toolkit
Overview

This repository contains various image processing scripts implemented in Python using OpenCV. The scripts cover a range of fundamental image processing techniques, including filtering, morphological operations, transformations, and enhancements.

Features

Blurring & Smoothing: Apply various blurring techniques to images.

Image Concatenation: Combine multiple images into a single output.

Contour Detection: Identify and extract object contours from images.

Image Cropping: Crop images to desired dimensions.

Morphological Transformations: Perform dilation and noise removal.

Edge Detection: Detect edges using algorithms like Canny.

Grayscale Conversion: Convert images to grayscale.

Histogram Equalization: Enhance image contrast using histogram equalization.

HSV Conversion: Convert images to HSV color space.

Multiple Image Handling: Open and process multiple images at once.

Resizing & Rotation: Resize and rotate images.

Template Matching: Implement template matching for object detection.

Installation

Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies.

pip install opencv-python numpy

Usage

Run individual scripts to apply specific transformations. Example usage:

python img_blur.py --image input.jpg

Modify the scripts as needed to suit your specific requirements.
